# LeetCode


- R.I.P. to my old Leetcode repository, where there were 5.7k+ stars and 2.2k+ forks (ever the top 3 in the field).
- Since free questions may be even mistakenly taken down by some companies, only solutions will be post on now.
- There are new LeetCode questions every week. I'll keep updating for full summary and better solutions.
- For more problem solutions, you can see my LintCode, GoogleKickStart, GoogleCodeJamIO repositories.
- For more challenging problem solutions, you can also see my GoogleCodeJam, MetaHackerCup repositories.
- Hope you enjoy the journey of learning data structures and algorithms.
- Notes: "lock" means your subscription of LeetCode premium membership is required for reading the question.
